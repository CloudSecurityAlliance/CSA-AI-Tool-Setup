# TODO


## Rewrite mac os install script 

* bash pull on Mac OS:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://PATH-TO-FILE)"
```

which will let us easily do interactive setup.

* Still check for the user data json in ~/Downloads/
* Ask for API keys 
* Ask for gmail address
* Support reading existing file and prompt "keep this value or update"
