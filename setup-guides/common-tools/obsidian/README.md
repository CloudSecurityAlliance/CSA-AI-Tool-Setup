# Obsidian Setup Guide

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base and note-taking application that works on top of local Markdown files. It's particularly useful for AI tool interactions, research, and documentation.

## Licensing and Support

Obsidian is free for personal use. While the Cloud Security Alliance, as a non-profit organization, isn't required to purchase licenses, we encourage users to support Obsidian's development through:
- Catalyst licenses (one-time support payment)
- Commercial licenses (for those who need/want them)

Please visit [Obsidian's pricing page](https://obsidian.md/pricing) to learn more about supporting the developers.

## File Synchronization

### Default Setup (iOS and macOS)
We use iCloud Drive as our default synchronization method because:
- Seamless integration with Apple devices
- Built into macOS and iOS
- Reliable sync performance
- No additional configuration needed

See our [iCloud Setup Guide](../icloud/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Android Users Note
If you're using Android mobile devices, alternative synchronization options are available (like Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, or Google Drive). However, these configurations are not covered in this guide. Please contact Cloud Security Alliance support for guidance on Android-compatible sync solutions.
