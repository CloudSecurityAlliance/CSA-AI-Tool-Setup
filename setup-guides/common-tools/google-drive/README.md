## Recommended Configuration

For AI tools use, we recommend:
1. Using "Stream files" by default to save space
2. Creating a dedicated folder for AI-related content
3. Setting that AI folder to "Mirror files" for offline access
4. Keeping your AI folder structure organized (separate folders for different tools/projects)

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Use selective sync to limit what's downloaded
- Regularly clean up unnecessary files
